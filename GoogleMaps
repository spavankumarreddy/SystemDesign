Things to consider if you want to design Google Maps
1) Images are usually heavy in size. How much memory would be requied to store so many maps?
2) How many nodes would be required to maintain such huge data?
3) What would be the traffic?
4) How can it Scale?

#1 How much memory?
Earth is about 500 million square kilometers
Lets say 70% of it is water and 20% of it is un important area. So remaining is 10% which is 50 million square Kilometers
For a block of 10m X 10m image, lets take the image size as 1MB
So, for a square kilo meter we would have around 10000 of above blocks, meaning 10,000MB
So, for 50 Million square kilo meters, it would be around 50 X 10^6 X 10,000MB = 500GB X 10^6 = 500 peta bytes
Assume a factor of 3.3 for zoom up and zoom down
a. 500 PB/3 = ~175 PB
b. 175 PB/3 = ~ 60 PB
c. 60 PB/3  = ~ 20 PB
So, overall the size would be around ~260 + ~500 = ~800 PB


#2 How many nodes?
Let's assume each node can handle around 15TB of data 
If we consider 2 replicas, we can store ~5TB of data in each node
So, for 800 PB --> 800 PB/5 TB = 8X10^5 TB/5 TB = 160000
So, we need around 160k nodes to handle this data

#3 How much traffic?
For example, we have around 500M monthly google map users
each user requires 30 minutes of navigation per month. So, we need 15000 million minutes = 15 billion minutes
How many images required depends on the speed of the user. Let's say seed is 30 km/hour
for 1 km, we need aournd 1 GB of images
for 30 km in an hour, 30 GB
Per minute, 30GB/60 = 30000 MB/60 = ~ 500 MB 
for 15 billion minutes = 15000 million * 500 MB = 75 X 10^5 X 1 MB
for a month there will be around 2.5 million seconds
So, for a second --> 7.5 X 10^6 X 1 MB/2.5 X 10^6 = 3 MB
So, traffic would be around 3MB/second 

in other words, if we want number of requests/second if we assume there will be 30 requests per user in 30 minutes --> 30 X 500M /2.5M seconds = 6000 requests/second

#4 6000 requests/second is manageable.
